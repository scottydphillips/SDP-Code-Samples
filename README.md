# Donation Handler
This folder is a redacted representive of a page I built for a nonprofit client that took donations from their WordPress home page. The page used Advanced Custom Fields to handle ease of content entry, and integrated with Stripe using an AJAX call, and then the donation handling.

# Benchmark Calculator
This folder is a benchmarking tool the client wanted to compare propierety data of theirs against benchmark and would identify if the user's company was above or below the benchmarks in certain areas, and then display the results. It also used Advanced Custom Fields to handle content entry, and compared the results against a JSON file, that I've not included.

## Due to replatforming efforts of these clients, these pages are no longer publically available
